# gta-heist-closer

Closes GTA when it detects the Heist Passed screen for Cayo Perico.

## Usage

- Install Python 3.11+ (this is the only version I tested)
- Download the code from the most recent release and unzip it somewhere
- Run `run.bat`

## Known Issues

- If you do not play GTA on your main monitor, _this will not work_. Fixing this is a WIP
